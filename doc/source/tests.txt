Tests
=====

The TDDA package includes a set of unit-tests, for testing that the package
is correctly installed and configured, and does not include any regressions.

To run these tests::

    tdda test

The output should look something like::

    .................................................................s....
    .........................s........................
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ran 120 tests in 1.849s

    OK (skipped=2)

Some tests may be skipped, if they depend on modules that are not installed
in your local environment (for instance, for testing TDDA database
functionality for databases for which you do not have drivers installed).

The overall test status should always be **OK**.
