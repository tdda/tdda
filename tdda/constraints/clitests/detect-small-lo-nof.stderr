Parameters:

  * input is one of:

      - a csv file
      - a .parquet file
      - any of the other supported data sources

  * constraints.tdda, if provided, is a JSON .tdda file constaining
    constraints.

  * name of output file (.csv, .parqet)
    where detection results are to be written.
    Can be - (or missing) to write to standard output.


Optional flags are:

  * -a, --all
      Report all fields, even if there are no failures
  * -f, --fields
      Report only fields with failures
  * -7, --ascii
      Report in ASCII form, without using special characters.
  * --epsilon E
      Use this value of epsilon for fuzziness in comparing numeric values.
  * --write-all
      Include passing records in the output.
  * --per-constraint
      Write one additional column per failing constraint, to show if a
      constraint passed or failed, as well as the n_failures
      total column for each row. This is set by default.
  * --no-per-constraint
      Disable the --per-constraint flag, so that the only constraint-based
      column written out is the nfailures field.
  * --no-original-fields
      Do not write out any of the original columns. By default, all of the
      original columns are written out, unless you use --output-fields.
  * --output-fields FIELD1 FIELD2 ...
      Specify original columns to write out.
  * --interleave
      In the output, place the verification fields immediately after
      the original field to which they correspond.
  * --index
      Include a row-number index in the output file.
      The row number is automatically included if no output fields are
      specified. Rows are usually numbered from 1, unless the
      input file already has an index.
